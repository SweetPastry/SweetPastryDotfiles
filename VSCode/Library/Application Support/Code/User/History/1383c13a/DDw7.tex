\spAbstract{%
    This file is reference solutions for \textit{Hard Analytical Mechanics} problem 20-22, made by \textit{Hai-Xuan Lin}. Problem 20 constructs an idealized scenario in classical mechanics that involves a momentum jumpâ€”an event that is impossible in reality. The nondifferentiable point in this case undermines the applicability of Hamilton's canonical equations, yet the angle variable theory remains usable.Problem 21 is somewhat mathematically intricate. It considers the case where a uniform field is superimposed on a Kepler field, causing the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector to lose its conservation and degenerate into a conserved quantity exhibiting lower symmetry. Problem 22 does not reveal any particularly profound insights; it merely examines the algebraic structure of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, thereby highlighting the scaling factor present in parabolic coordinates.
