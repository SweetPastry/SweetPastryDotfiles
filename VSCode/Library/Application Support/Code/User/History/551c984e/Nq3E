LFS Service

Administrator Haixuan Lin has set up a Git LFS[^1] (Large File Storage) service on his server cluster at:
hxlin@10.26.0.253:/home2/Raman.

Git LFS is used to track and manage large files such as:
	‚Ä¢	.pth ‚Äî PyTorch trained model files
	‚Ä¢	.cif ‚Äî Crystallographic Information Files
	‚Ä¢	.x ‚Äî X-ray experiments data file
	‚Ä¢	Other large experimental output files



‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è How to Install Git LFS

If Git LFS is not installed on your system, you can install it as follows:

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install git-lfs

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install git-lfs

# Windows (Scoop)
scoop install git-lfs

Then, initialize it in your Git environment (only once):

git lfs install

üöÄ How to Use This Repository

If you‚Äôre only interested in the source code (not experimental data):

If you haven‚Äôt cloned the repository yet:

git clone https://gitee.com/sweetpastry/raman.git

If you‚Äôve already cloned it:

git pull

If you also need experimental data or trained models:

After cloning or pulling, run:

git lfs pull

[^1]: Git LFS (Large File Storage) is an extension to Git that enables efficient version control of large files.
Instead of storing the full contents of large files in the Git repository, Git LFS stores lightweight references and offloads the actual file contents to a separate storage server. This helps keep the repository lightweight and fast, even when tracking large models and datasets.
