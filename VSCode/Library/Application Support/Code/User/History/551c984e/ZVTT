LFS Service

Administrator Haixuan Lin has set up a Git LFS[^1] (Large File Storage) service on his server cluster at:
hxlin@10.26.0.253:/home2/Raman.

Git LFS is used to track and manage large files such as:
	•	.pth — PyTorch trained model files
	•	.cif — Crystallographic Information Files
	•	.x — X-ray experiments data file
	•	Other large experimental output files

If you’re only interested in the source code (not experimental data) and haven’t cloned the repository yet:
```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/sweetpastry/raman.git
```
If you’ve already cloned it:
```bash
git pull
```
If you also need experimental data or trained models, after cloning or pulling, run:
```bash
git lfs pull
```

If you encounter any issues related to LFS, such as:
	•	Failure to download large files
	•	LFS authentication errors
	•	Access denied when pulling tracked files
	•	Suspected service downtime or misconfiguration

Please contact the administrator.



[^1]: Git LFS (Large File Storage) is an extension to Git that enables efficient version control of large files.
Instead of storing the full contents of large files in the Git repository, Git LFS stores lightweight references and offloads the actual file contents to a separate storage server. This helps keep the repository lightweight and fast, even when tracking large models and datasets.
If Git LFS is not installed on your system, you can install it as follows:
```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install git-lfs
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
# Windows (Scoop)
scoop install git-lfs
```
Then, initialize it in your Git environment (only once):
```bash
git lfs install
```
