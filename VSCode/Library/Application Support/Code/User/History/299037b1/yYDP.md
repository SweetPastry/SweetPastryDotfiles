Homeschooling is time-saving, which is convinient for those students who live far from school and waste lots of time on commuting. As we all know, in China every student 8-10h classes in day. In some provinces, students even get up before 6:30am for catching bus to school, resulting in shortened sleep time. It is bad for health, and in some sense, meaningless. Homeschooling solves this problem, it cut expenditure of time on commuting, and those saved time student can spend on rest or do homework.
