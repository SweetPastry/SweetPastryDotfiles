Homeschooling significantly reduces time wastage, particularly benefiting students in remote areas who endure long commutes. In China, the typical school schedule requires 8-10 hours of daily classes, with students in some provinces rising before 6:30 AM to reach school on time. This leads to sleep deprivation, harming both health and academic efficiency. Homeschooling eliminates unnecessary commuting, allowing students to reallocate saved time toward rest, independent study, or homework completion, thereby improving overall well-being and productivity.
